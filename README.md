**üìå Task 1: Big Data Analysis** 

This repository contains my work for Task 1 of my Data Analytics Internship. In this task, I performed Big Data Analysis using PySpark in Google Colab. The focus was to gain hands-on experience in data processing, manipulation, and analysis using Apache Spark's PySpark module‚Äîa powerful framework for handling big data efficiently.

**üìå Task Overview**

The main goal of this task was to explore and analyze a dataset using PySpark, which is widely used for scalable and distributed data processing. The dataset used contains retail transaction data. Using PySpark, I carried out several operations including data inspection, filtering, aggregation, transformation, and sorting.

This analysis showcases how PySpark can be used to handle large datasets that might be challenging for traditional Python libraries like pandas. It also highlights how simple data processing workflows can be scaled using Spark‚Äôs distributed computing capabilities.


**üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used**

Programming Language: Python

Big Data Framework: PySpark (Apache Spark‚Äôs Python API)

Platform: Google Colab (for cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment)



**üìå Key PySpark Concepts Practiced**

SparkSession Creation

Reading CSV data with schema inference

Data exploration (show, schema, describe, select)

Data filtering using conditions

GroupBy and aggregation functions

Adding new columns and renaming

Sorting data

Unique value identification



**üìå Applications of Big Data Analysis with PySpark**

This type of analysis is highly applicable in real-world domains such as:

**Retail and E-commerce**: Understanding customer behavior, sales trends, and high-performing products.

**Healthcare**: Analyzing large volumes of patient records for insights.

**Finance**: Detecting fraud, risk modeling, and transaction analysis.

**Social Media**: Processing user data for content recommendations and engagement insights.

**Telecommunications**: Analyzing call records and network data for improving service quality.





This task gave me an excellent foundation in working with big data tools. I now understand how large datasets can be processed more efficiently using PySpark‚Äôs data frames, operations, and distributed architecture. The experience gained here lays the groundwork for more advanced data analytics tasks in this internship.
